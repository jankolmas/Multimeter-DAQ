Multimeter-DAQ
==============
Windows application for plotting and storing data from up to four digital multimeters at once.

Created by Jan Kolmas during summer 2012 as side project for Yale's Gomez Lab (http://www.eng.yale.edu/gomez-lab/).
This repository contains both the executable (located in Multimeter-DAQ/DAQ-test/bin/debug/DAQ Test.exe), the project files as well
as the source code.
