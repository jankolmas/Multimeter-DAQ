# Multimeter-DAQ

Windows application for plotting and storing data from up to four digital multimeters at once.

Created by Jan Kolmas during summer 2012 as side project for Yale's Gomez Lab (http://www.eng.yale.edu/gomez-lab/).
This repository contains both the executable (located in Multimeter-DAQ/DAQ-test/bin/debug/DAQ Test.exe), the project files as well
as the source code.
